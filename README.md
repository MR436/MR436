With a passion for leveraging data to drive insights and decision-making. I have experience in various aspects of the data science lifecycle, including data collection, pre-processing, modeling, and visualization.

Analytical and detailed-oriented professional with over 12 years of experience, I have a proven track record of delivering results and driving business growth. I am a strategic thinker who is passionate about leveraging data to make informed decisions and uncover new opportunities.
In recent years, I have become increasingly interested in the field of data science and the potential it has to transform businesses. My deep understanding of customer behavior and market trends, combined with my strong analytical skills, make me well-suited to transition into a data science role.

I am committed to staying at the forefront of industry trends and techniques and have completed numerous courses and certifications in data science, statistics, and machine learning. I am also proficient in a range of data analysis tools and programming languages, including Python, SQL, Tableau

Successful Projects :

-Computer Vision Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS) project, in which the user trained a computer vision model. The model detects whether the user shows Rock, Paper, or Scissors to the camera, so the user can leverage that output to play an RPS game with the computer.

-Airbnb Listing project,  which develop a multitude of  classification & regression models and compare their performance across different use cases.  

-Data Centralisation project, transforming and analysing large datasets from multiple data sources. By utilising the power of Pandas,  clean the data, and produce a STAR based database schema for optimised data storage and access. The project also builds complex SQL-based data queries, allowing to extract valuable insights and make informed decisions. This project provide the user with the experience of building a real-life complete data solution, from data acquisition to analysis, all in one place.
